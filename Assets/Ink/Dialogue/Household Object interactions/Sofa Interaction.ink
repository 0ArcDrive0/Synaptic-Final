This is the couch we've had for so many years

its red cover used to be much brighter, but its naturally been neglected and not taken care of

I remember clearly that our parents wern't the biggest clean freaks, more of it was me and my sister who we're really cleaning up any spills and mess

...

Just like if they were to argue and things would be found broken in the morning...
